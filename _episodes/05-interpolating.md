It is common in climate data analysis to need to interpolate data to a different grid.  One example is that I have model data on a model grid and observed data on a different grid. I want to calculate a difference between model and obs. 

In this lesson, We will make a difference between the average SST in a CMIP5 model historical simulation and the average observed SSTs from the OISSTv2 dataset we have been working with. 


## Regular Grid

If you are using a regular grid, interpolation is easy using `xarray`.  

A regular grid is one with a 1-dimensional latitude and 1-dimensional longitude. This means that the latitudes are the same for all longitudes and the longitudes are the same for all latitudes.

Most data you encounter will be on a regular grid, but some are not.  We will discuss irregular grids in another class.


## First Steps

Create a new notebook and save it as Interpolating.ipynb.

Import the standard set of packages we use:

~~~
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import cartopy.crs as ccrs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
~~~
{: .language-python}

Read in obs and mask data:

~~~
obs_file='/shared/obs/gridded/OISSTv2/monthly/sst.mnmean.nc'
ds_obs=xr.open_dataset(data_file)
ds_obs
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
mask_file='/shared/obs/gridded/OISSTv2/lmask/lsmask.nc'
ds_mask=xr.open_dataset(mask_file)
ds_mask
~~~
{: .language-python}

This is the original data file we read in and land/sea mask we previously used.

Remember, we want to reverse the lats

~~~
ds_mask=ds_mask.reindex(lat=list(reversed(ds_mask['lat'])))
ds_obs=ds_obs.reindex(lat=list(reversed(ds_obs['lat'])))
plt.contourf(ds_obs['sst'][0,:,:])
~~~
{: .language-python}

Read in the model data

~~~
model_path='/shared/cmip5/data/historical/atmos/mon/Amon/ts/NCAR.CCSM4/r1i1p1/'
model_file='ts_Amon_CCSM4_historical_r1i1p1_185001-200512.nc'
ds_model=xr.open_dataset(model_path+model_file)
ds_model
~~~
{: .language-python}

This data has lats from S to N, so we don't need to reverse it.
Take a look at our model data.  This data appears to have different units than the obs data. 

We can change this.

~~~
ds_model['ts']=ds_model['ts']-273.15
~~~
{: .language-python}

Remember that `xarray` keeps our metadata with our data, so we need to also change the metadata to keep that information correct in our `xarray.Dataset`

~~~
ds_model['ts'].attrs['units']=ds_obs['sst'].attrs['units']
~~~
{: .language-python}

How would you take the time mean of each dataset?

~~~
ds_model_mean=ds_model.mean(dim='time')
ds_obs_mean=ds_obs.mean(dim='time')
ds_model_mean
~~~
{: .language-python}

We are now going to use the `interp_like` function.  The [documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.interp_like.html) tells us that this fucntion interpolates an object onto the coordinates of another object, filling out of range values with `NaN`.

One important thing to know that is not clear in the documentation is that the coordinates and variable name to interpolate must all be the same.

All variables in the `Dataset` that have the same name as the one we are interpolating to will be interpolated.

Both of our datasets use lat and lon, but the model dataset uses `ts` and the obs dataset uses `sst`.  Let's change the name of the model variable to `sst`.

~~~
ds_model_mean=ds_model_mean.rename({'ts':'sst'})
~~~
{: .language-python}

We will interpolate the model to be like the obs. 

~~~
model_interp=ds_model_mean.interp_like(ds_obs_mean)
model_interp
~~~
{: .language-python}

Let's take a look and compare with our data before interpolation.

~~~
plt.contourf(model_interp['sst'],cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Interpolated')
plt.colorbar()
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
plt.contourf(ds_model_mean['sst'],cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Original')
plt.colorbar()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Now let's see how different our model mean is from the obs mean. Remember to apply our land/ocean mask.

~~~
diff=(model_interp-ds_obs_mean).where(ds_mask['mask'].squeeze()==1)
diff
~~~
{: .language-python}

And plot it...

~~~
plt.title('Model - OBS')
plt.contourf(diff['sst'], cmap='coolwarm')
plt.colorbar()
~~~
{: .language-python}
